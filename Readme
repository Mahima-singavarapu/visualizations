This project focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization using a rainfall dataset.
The goal is to understand weather patterns, rainfall trends and relationships between meteorological variables through multiple visualization techniques.

Column Name	Description
date	Date of observation
rainfall	Amount of rainfall (mm)
temperature	Average temperature (°C)
humidity	Relative humidity (%)
wind_speed	Wind speed (km/h)
weather_condition	Weather type (Rainy / Sunny)


Analyze rainfall patterns over time
Compare weather conditions and rainfall levels
Identify relationships between temperature, humidity, wind speed, and rainfall
Visualize data using industry-standard chart types
Provide meaningful insights using KPIs and EDA techniques

KPIs:
Total Rainfall: Sum of rainfall across all days
Average Temperature: Mean daily temperature
Average Humidity: Mean humidity level
Number of Rainy Days: Days with rainfall > 0

1. Bar & Column Charts

Used to compare average rainfall by weather condition

Helps identify which weather type contributes more rainfall

2. Line Charts (Time Series)

Displays rainfall trends over time

Useful for detecting increases, decreases, or seasonal behavior

3. Tables, Filters & Slicers

Tabular views allow easy filtering (e.g., only rainy days)

Helps in focused analysis

4. Stacked Bar & Pie Charts (Composition)

Shows the proportion of Rainy vs Sunny days

Useful for understanding weather distribution

5. Funnel Chart

Rainfall values sorted from highest to lowest

Highlights days with the most rainfall

6. Pareto Chart

Identifies which days contribute most to total rainfall

Follows the 80/20 principle

7. Heatmap

Displays correlations between rainfall, temperature, humidity, and wind speed

Helps identify strong or weak relationships

8. Small Multiples

Multiple line charts displayed together

Enables easy comparison of different weather variables over time

9. Distribution Charts

Histogram: Shows rainfall frequency distribution

Box Plot: Identifies spread and outliers in rainfall data

10. Scatter Plot (Relationship Analysis)

Shows relationship between temperature and rainfall

Colored by weather condition for better insight

Shows relationship between temperature and rainfall

Colored by weather condition for better insight
